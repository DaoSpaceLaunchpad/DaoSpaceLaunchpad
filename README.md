# DaoSpace

DaoSpace is a 100% community-driven launchpad platform that allows its community to participate in BSC, Polygon, Ethereum, and other ecosystem pre-sales from a single point. Additionally, DaoSpace invests early in projects with high potential and distributes its earnings to its community. As the community grows, DaoSpace aims to organize at least one IDO per month and include its community members in other ecosystem sales.

## How DaoSpace Works?

Investors can buy DaoSpace Tokens and become holders of the DaoSpace LaunchPad. The number of DaoSpace Tokens held in wallets qualifies investors to participate in IDOs. Pre-sales to participate in are determined by community votes.

## NFT-DAO

NFT-DAO aims to create the main funding power and give its community a say in the decision-making process of the projects. Investors must have at least one NFT to be a member of the DAO System, and the number of NFTs is limited to 100 pieces. DAO members have the highest allocation pool without holding DAOP token.

## Investor Responsibilities

As an investor, you only need to hold your DaoSpace Tokens in your wallet. However, if you consider yourself a part of the DaoSpace community and want to support its growth, we would be happy to have you.

## Tier System

The tier system of DaoSpace will be changed according to market conditions and community decisions. The distribution of allocation pools will be done according to the DaoSpace tier system. The current tier system is as follows:

- üíé Diamond Tier: DAO NFT HOLDERS (Highest Allocation Pool)
- ü•á Tier 1: 100.000 DAOP and more (Guaranteed Allocation)
- ü•à Tier 2: 50.000 - 99.999 DAOP (Guaranteed Allocation)
- ü•â Tier 3: 20.000 - 49.999 DAOP (Guaranteed Allocation)
- üèÖ Tier 4: 10.000 - 19.999 DAOP (Guaranteed Allocation)
